%description
The public fetch_drivers package is a binary only release. fetch_drivers
contains both the drivers and firmware for the fetch and freight research
robots. There should be no reason to use these drivers unless you're running on
a fetch or a freight research robot. This package, is a cmake/make only package
which installs the binaries for the drivers and firmware.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
