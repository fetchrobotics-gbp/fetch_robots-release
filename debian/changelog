    This fixes #1181 <https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_drivers/issues/1181> and can fix fetchrobotics/fetch_ros#86 <https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_ros/issues/86>
    Upstream urdf/model.h has changed, and a fix backported to indigo.
    The fix is only available if you upgrade your ROS indigo pacakges.
    This fix should work for all three cases
    backport not available, backport available, backport not needed.
  * [C++] catch errors by const ref (#1201 <https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_drivers/issues/1201>)
    This fixes the warning as error:
    catching polymorphic type ‘class std::runtime_error’ by value
    [-Werror=catch-value=]

    Fix incorrect virtual function in ChargerStatusGenerator class.
  * Fix incorrect virtual function in ChargerStatusGenerator class.
    Virtual function should be collect(void) not collect(double).
    Because base class provided default collect(), there was no compile time error, but diagnostics output for charger was mostly garbage.
    Add "override" to all sub-class virtual function definitions so this would cause a compile time error if this happens again.
    Remove virtual from all sub-class function definitions (it is redudant, and kind silly now that override exists)
  * Add units to system time in read_board
  * Merge pull request #1033 <https://github.com/fetchrobotics/fetch_drivers/issues/1033> from briancairl/NAV-1006
